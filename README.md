Welcome to my repository for the #100DaysOfCode challenge, where I completed a series of Python projects over 100 days. This collection showcases my journey of learning Python through hands-on programming, building mini-projects, and mastering core concepts.

ðŸ“– Overview

Through 100 lectures, I explored Python programming by applying theoretical knowledge to practical projects. This challenge helped me build a strong foundation in coding, problem-solving, and disciplined learning.

ðŸ§  What I Learned

Python Fundamentals: Syntax, variables, and control structures (if-else, loops).
Data Structures: Lists, sets, dictionaries, and their real-world applications.
Looping Techniques: Various forms of for and while loops for efficient coding.
Random Module: Leveraging Python's random module and understanding the Mersenne Twister algorithm.

ðŸš€ Projects

Here are some of the key projects included in this repository:

Hangman Game: A word-guessing game with interactive gameplay.
Caesar Cipher Tool: A program for encrypting anddecrypting text using the Caesar cipher technique.
Blackjack Game: A card game simulation implementing game logic and rules.
Number Guessing Game: A fun game to guess a randomly generated number.
Rock-Paper-Scissors: A classic game with user and computer choice
Password Generator: A tool to create secure, random passwords.
The Snake Game : 
The Pong Game :



...and many more!

Each project is designed to reinforce specific Python concepts and improve my coding skills.

ðŸŒŸ The Journey

The #100DaysOfCode challenge was a transformative experience. Beyond writing code, it taught me:


Discipline: Committing to daily coding and consistent learning.
Curiosity: Exploring new Python features and problem-solving techniques.
Confidence: Tackling complex problems and building functional projects.

This milestone marks the beginning of my programming journey, and I'm excited to continue learning and building!
